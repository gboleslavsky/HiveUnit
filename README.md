# HiveUnit
This framework facilitates Test Driven Development of Hive scripts. It does so without any dependencies on local install of any Hadoop software.
It is designed to run as a java jar and is to be invoked by shell scripts. The command level API consists of five commands so far, and can be trivially extended to support an arbitrary number of commands, each with its own set of parameters. Here are the commands supported so far:
excel_to_hql -- given an .xlsx file formatted as shown in spreadsheets in the data folder, generates a folder on the file system, currently named hql, with a set of folders, one per statement type, of HQL DDL and DML statements needed to conduct an automated test
load         -- given the hql folder created by excel_to_hql (previous command), runs CREATE TABLE and INSERT scripts to load input data
hive         -- runs script or scripts under test, as configured in the conf sheet of the test definition spreadsheet
assert       -- obtains ACTUAL results by running SELECT statements generated by excel_to_hql and compares to EXPECTED data specified in the test definition spreadsheet
clean        -- runs TRUNCATE statements generated by excel_to_hql for both input and expected tables to prepare for the next run
